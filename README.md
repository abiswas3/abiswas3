After almost a 5 year hiatus from writing code, I've dived back into open source development.
Below is a list of things I've been working on/completed.
Recently, I've been working closely with [Justin Thaler](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/) on [SNARK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg6lKPdR_e4) related work

# Stuff I'm working on
